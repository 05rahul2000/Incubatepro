In colleges and universities, an incubation cell, often referred to as a "Business Incubator" or "Entrepreneurship Center," is a dedicated space or department that supports and nurtures student startups and entrepreneurial ventures. The primary goal of an incubation cell is to provide resources, mentorship, and infrastructure to help students turn their innovative ideas into viable and sustainable businesses.
